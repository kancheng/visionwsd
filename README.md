# VISIONWSD: Visual Inference: Segmentation and Object Network

VISIONWSD is a web-based project for image analysis that integrates state-of-the-art models for object detection and image segmentation. Initially, it leverages the YOLO model for detection and segmentation tasks, and future iterations will incorporate additional models such as UNet and more, offering a versatile platform for various computer vision applications.

## Overview

The **VISIONWSD** project is designed to provide a unified web interface for processing images and videos using cutting-edge computer vision models. Users can upload files to perform:
- **Image Detection:** Locate and classify objects within an image.
- **Image Segmentation:** Delineate objects or regions in an image with precise masks.

This platform is ideal for research, prototyping, and deployment of various computer vision tasks in a web environment.

## Features

- **Web-based Upload:** Simple user interface to upload images or videos.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Real-time progress tracking of processing tasks.
- **Multi-Model Support:** Currently includes YOLO for detection/segmentation and will expand to support UNet and other models.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizes background processing to handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the user interface.
- **Result Visualization:** Displays processed images or videos directly on the web page.

## Supported Models

- **YOLO:** Used for real-time object detection and segmentation.
- **UNet (Planned):** A popular model for image segmentation tasks.
- *Other models can be added as needed to expand the capabilities of the platform.*

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kancheng/visionwsd.git
   cd visionwsd
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download model weights:**

   Ensure you have the required model weights (e.g., `yolov8n-seg.pt` for YOLO) in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the upload form.

3. **Upload and Process:**

   - Select an image or video file.
   - Click "Upload" and monitor the progress.
   - View the processed result once completed.
